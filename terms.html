           <div class="reservation">
           	<h4>Reservation conditions</h4>
           	&nbsp  &nbsp Tables are available for two hours or such shorter time communicated to you 
           	in your booking confirmation, after which they will be re-booked for another customer. 
           	Please contact us if you would like to stay at your table for longer than two hours and, 
           	if we have space available, we will do our best to accommodate you.
           	For tables booked at 1.30pm or later, or 8pm or later, your table will not be re-booked, 
           	but please do let us know if you'd like to stay for longer than two hours.<br>
           	&nbsp  &nbsp We respectfully ask that you are ready to be seated at the time of your reservation to ensure 
           	the best possible level of service to all of our guests. If you are running late, 
           	we kindly ask that you notify us by telephone at your earliest convenience. 
           	Your table will be held for 15 minutes after which time it may be allocated to another customer.<br>
           &nbsp  &nbsp Should you wish to have a drink prior to being seated, please arrive earlier or change your reservation to a later time. 
           You may continue your experience in the bar (Banjo and Oyster Box) or on the terrace (weather permitting at Oyster Box) 
           for drinks after your meal.<br><br>
           </div>
           <div class="cancel"> 
           <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>
           &nbsp  &nbsp We require at least four hours' notice for every cancellation. 
           For bookings cancelled with less than four hours' notice, we will charge £10.00 per person 
           if we are unable to resell the table. In the event that you do not show up, 
           we may charge £15.00 per person. We also may request a deposit to guarantee a table on on busy days. 
           We are sorry that cancellation charges and deposits have become necessary, 
           but we have had too many “no-shows” resulting in empty tables we could have reserved for other customers.<br>
           </div>
           <div class="table">
           	<h4>Table Allocation</h4>
           	&nbsp  &nbsp Due to the large number of requests, unfortunately we cannot guarantee window tables or specific areas when taking reservations, 
           	but we will do our best to accommodate your requests. Your understanding is appreciated.<br>
           	&nbsp  &nbsp Due to the large number of requests, unfortunately we cannot guarantee window tables or specific areas 
           	when taking reservations, but we will do our best to accommodate your requests. Your understanding is appreciated.<br>
           </div>
           <div class="food">
           <h4>Food safety & allergens</h4>
           &nbsp  &nbsp We respectfully ask that food that has not been prepared in our kitchens is not consumed on our premises. For the avoidance of doubt, 
           this includes celebratory cakes so please ask if you would like a cake made at Banjo or Oyster Box. 
           Jersey Crab Shack offers celebratory puddings only. At least 48 hours' notice is required, 
           so please call or e-mail your chosen restaurant as far in advance as possible. 
           The reasons we have implemented this policy are that we are (i) often unable to find a place to store the cake in a fridge, 
           which is often required for food safety purposes, (ii) the service of food not on the menu can impact our quality of service 
           to the customer who brought the cake and customers on other tables, especially if we were not warned in advance, 
           (iii) in the event of an alleged food poisoning or serious allergic reaction of one of our guests, 
           we would be unable to trace the source in accordance with our Food Safety procedures.<br>
           </div>
           <div class="payments">
           	<h4>Cashless Payments</h4>
           	&nbsp &nbsp Please note that JPRestaurants no longer accepts cash in any of our restaurants or cafés. 
           	Payments can be made by Kpay,Wavepay,Visa, Mastercard, Amex and debit cards. 
           	We can also receive payment via Apple Pay and Google Pay.<br>
           </div>
           <div class="covid">
           	<h4>Covid-19</h4>
           	&nbsp &nbsp By making a booking, guests confirm that they agree to adhere to any relevant Government requirements that may be 
           	in place at the time of their reservation, including, but not limited to, providing contact details for the purposes of track & trace; 
           	wearing face masks; and practicing physical distancing, if required. Guests also confirm that they do not have symptoms of covid-19.<br>
           </div>
           <div class="poliacy">
           	<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
           	&nbsp &nbsp We have a detailed Privacy Policy dealing with how we use your personal information.
           </div>
           <div class="wifi">
           	<h4>Guest WiFi</h4>
           	&nbsp &nbsp By accessing our guest WiFi, you agree that you are of legal age, and have read, understood, and accept our terms and conditions.<br>
